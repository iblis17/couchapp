Using backbone.js with CouchApp
================================

Backbone.js_ is minimalist mvc framework for JavaScript, written by
Jeremy Ashkenas, the author of coffee script. Backbone is a good choice
for creating larger CouchApps, as an alternative to Evently. A robust
backbone-couchdb connector that supports realtime updates via the
`_changes` feed is supported by Jan Monschke.

to CouchApp with backbone.js_ by Jan.

Extended version of backbone_ couch connector (with fixing some
issues, extending functionality) is available here:
