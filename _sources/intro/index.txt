Introduction
============

CouchApps are JavaScript and HTML5 applications served directly from CouchDB.
If you can fit your application into those constraints,
then you get CouchDB's scalability and flexibility **for free**
(and deploying your app is as simple as replicating it to the production server).

There are also tools for deploying browser-based
apps to JSON web servers and `PouchDB <http://pouchdb.com/>`_
is the future of browser based sync apps. It can sync with the same sync
protocols but uses the built-in storage of HTML5.
