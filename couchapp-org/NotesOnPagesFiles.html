used to create dynamic options in the navigation depending on login

<p>The core jQuery library, json library, couch library and the secure hash
library are loaded directly from the filesystem (on OSX _utils maps to
a directory located at /Applications/CouchDBX-

<p>The other jQuery plugins do the heavy lifting in communicating with the
couchdb, creating final html with mustache, triggering and reacting to
events in the browser with evently, and binding events to a url while
making them bookmarkable.</p>
<p>Pathbinder is used in the logic to select the proper evently reaction
and pass parameters.</p>

<div class="section" id="init-folder">
<h5>_init (folder)<a class="headerlink" href="#init-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The _init action is fired automatically upon the widget being called.
It can either be a single javascript file, or alternatively a folder
with collected javascript, templates and json to acheive what is
required. In Pages it is a folder.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>after.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>after.js is run last in the widget :) In this case, it is a simply uses
jQuery to select all items with the class &#8220;date&#8221; and applies the
prettyDate function from jquery.couch.app.util.js to it to make friendly
dates like &#8220;yesterday&#8221; and &#8220;2 months ago&#8221;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>data.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>data.js provides the dynamic data from couchdb to be used in displaying
the mustache template. It takes a view from couchdb which is defined in
the sibling query.js file (in this case recent-comments) and returns a
json object with fields that match the variables in the mustache.html
template in the same director.</p>
<p>The variables at the top of the file are used to make it easy to refer
to the page element and store data in a related object.</p>
<p>The $$ notation allows you to grab a jQuery object that is related to
the #wiki div where the current couchdb document _id has been stored in
the property docid.</p>
<p>$$ also allows you to access the application easily. The third line uses
this to create a variable &#8220;linkup&#8221; and makes it into a mini-library with
a single function (encode) which takes the body text, runs it through
the mustache library to escape any nasties, then (with a regex) turns
any text urls into working links that open in a new window.</p>
<p>The view returns a json object where the key is an array of the page
name and comment datetime. The value is the document itself (eg the
comment). This is then converted into the returned json object for use
in the template.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&#8220;topic&#8221; is set from the property docid that was stored on the #wiki
div</li>
<li>&#8220;title&#8221; is also set from the property title that was stored on the
#wiki div</li>
<li>&#8220;comments&#8221; is an array of comment objects (one for each row returned
from the view)</li>
</ul>
<p>The map of rows has the anonymous function applied to each item and
turns the data into another simple json object holding the:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&#8220;gravatar_url&#8221; from the comment authors profile in the nested &#8220;by&#8221;
object to display the avatar</li>
<li>&#8220;by&#8221; the nickname from &#8220;by&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;at&#8221; the second part of the array from the key (eg the datatime)</li>
<li>&#8220;comment&#8221; the body text of the comment converted back from markdown
to html with links linkupped</li>
</ul>
<p>So now the mustache template can display the first level parts of the
variable directly and itereate over the nested objects for repeated
sections.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>mustache.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The template for displaying the comments. It is simple html with double
curly braces to surround variable replacements.</p>
<p>The object returned from data.js above supplies the information for the
replacement. A title is placed at the top of the section, then each
comment becomes a list item which is styled from the main.css. Finally
the comment form is rendered at the end with a textarea for new comments
and a hidden field &#8220;topic&#8221; which has a reference to the document id.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>query.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This file is a function that returns a json object with the name of the
view to run and the start and end key set to the document id. In effect,
the view doesn&#8217;t have a time limit defined in
views/recent-comments/map.js so it will list <em>all</em> the comments, then
the start and end key will narrow it down to the comments related to the
single document we are looking at.</p>
<p>startkey is the docid by itself because the natural sorting of keys by
the database will make this the first possible row returned. The endkey
includes an empty object because that would be the last possible row
returned and will include comments from all possible times.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>selectors (folder)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In this case it is a container folder. Items listed inside it relate to
dom elements and the files inside are named as the events that happen to
those elements.</p>
<p>Alternatively this could be replaced by a selectors.json file that
contains an object with keys of the dom element and another object keyed
to the event and containing an array of functions to call.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="s">&quot;a[href=#signup]&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&quot;click&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;signupForm&quot;</span><span class="p">]},</span>
       <span class="s">&quot;a[href=#login]&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&quot;click&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;loginForm&quot;</span><span class="p">]}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Essentially, couchapp will create a similar json structure from the
directory structure on push.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p># form</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>As described above, this folder identifies the dom element (form) that
the event file inside relates to.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>## submit.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This is the submit event for the form dom element in the comments
widget. So it is called when someone submits a comment on the page.</p>
<p>A private variable called &#8220;form&#8221; is created to refer to &#8220;this&#8221; without
confusing context. $$ notation allows us to retrieve the application by
picking it from the dom element &#8220;app&#8221;. It was placed there by line 33 of
templates/page.html where evently associates the comments widget with
the comments div and adds a property of app to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;f&#8221; then serializes the form putting the submitted fields/values from
the mustache template (comment, topic and submit) in as properties.</p>
<p>Other record metadata is added to the object to allow for searching in
views such as &#8220;type&#8221; which specifies the record type, &#8220;at&#8221; which is the
current datetime, &#8220;by&#8221; is a copy of the authors profile object.</p>
<p>Then using the &#8220;app&#8221; the database saveDoc method is called submitting
new comment document and then triggering the _init event on the
#comments div again to redraw the view with the updated information.</p>
<p>The function then returns false to prevent the browser trying to submit
normally.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="profile-folder">
<h4>profile (folder)<a class="headerlink" href="#profile-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This upper folder works in conjunction with and overrides some aspects
of the evently profile widget in vendor/couchapp/evently/profile</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="loggedout-folder">
<h5>loggedOut (folder)<a class="headerlink" href="#loggedout-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>loggedOut is one of the 3 states in the account widget (adminParty,
loggedIn, loggedOut) and the profile widget is connected to the account
widget on line 29 of templates/page.html, so whenever the sister event
fires in the account widget, it is also fired in the profile widget.
This allows you to present different content depending on whether the
user is logged in and has a profile.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>all.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In the case of loggedOut the all.html and the mustache.html template
both show the same thing. It is a snippet of html used to render the
menu links for Home, Changes and Comments pages. Note the urls are not
standard couchdb lists or shows. This is because there is a json file
called rewrites.json at the top level that converts these urls to the
standard.</p>
<p>So ../page/index becomes _show/page/index or run the &#8220;show&#8221; called
&#8220;page&#8221; with the document called &#8220;index&#8221; whereas the recent on runs a
&#8220;list&#8221; called &#8220;pages&#8221; with the &#8220;recent-changes&#8221; view providing the data</p>
<p>In effect it is mostly about removing the editing links etc from the
navigation bar when the user logs out.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>mustache.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Identical to above all.html</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="profileready-folder">
<h5>profileReady (folder)<a class="headerlink" href="#profileready-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The core profile widget in vendor/couchapp/evently has a loggedIn.js
file which fires when the user inputs their username and password. That
file then checks to see if the user has an existing profile object and
fires profileReady if it does, or noProfile if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The higher level profileReady and the files it contains overrides the
default ones with identical names and add additional content that is
activated by ??? (eg all.html)</p>
<p>In the wiki application the users profile is used for two main purposes</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Stamping documents with author details</li>
<li>Displaying different navigation options to logged in users verses the
public</li>
</ol>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>all.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>??</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>mustache.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This version of the html template shows the additional links for logged
in users that allow editing, history and uploading.</p>
<p>The links use the hash in the url to pass a path and and a parameter to
application. Note: This may seem like an authentication system, but the
urls are still directly accessible. Security if needed must be
approached in a different manner.</p>
<p>The link Edit makes evently check each widget look for a function that
has a path.txt file which contains /edit only and triggers that event.
In this case it is the &#8220;wiki&#8221; widget in evently/wiki/edit/path.txt</p>
<p>Similarly, the #/history is in tools/history/path.txt and #/version
tools/history/path.txt</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>async.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>???  Needs some clarification here
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Typically callbacks are used for event handlers and this one is making
an Ajax call which are asynchronous so you don&#8217;t know when (or if) a
response will come. I guess async.js is to specify that it happens when
it happens and doesn&#8217;t hold anything else up. Perhaps this is because
the page may have to wait for the database to provide the page and it
will load it when it is ready.</p>
<p>As previously, the variables wiki, app and docid are populated from the
dom, the attached app and the attached document id respectively.</p>
<p>Then the app uses the function openDoc from jquery.couch.js to retrieve
the document with a success continuation passes it to &#8220;cb&#8221; which makes
async = the current document.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>data.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Because we are dealing with the history of the documents we need to
understand how the older versions are stored within the current
document. They are serialized, then stored as an attachment to the
current document so you can restore them exactly at any time. So the
variables in data.js are a &#8220;versions&#8221; array to hold them all,</p>
<p>First a &#8220;topVersionNum&#8221; function is defined that takes the document
retrieved by async.js and checks for attachments. Then it walks through
the attachments scanning each for a string starting &#8220;rev&#8221; which it then
splits off the revision number (revNum) and checks to see if it is the
latest and sets the topVer. Next it checks the document for a property
called &#8220;log&#8221; and walks through the array until it finds the property
rev_num which it sets topLog to the revision number if it is greater.
Finally it returns the highest version number whether it is the log
version or the revision.</p>
<p>This result is then stored in the topVer variable.</p>
<p>Now a loop from 1 to the highest revision number is created and each is
compared to the log entries on the document. If the log entry has a
document rev_num then the old document attachment is pushed into the
&#8220;versions&#8221; array along with some metadata about who edited it and any
notes. If it no longer exists (say after database compaction) it is
marked as missing.</p>
<p>Finally it returns an object with the document id, the title and the
versions in an array that is sorted in descending order.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>mustache.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This template creates a new div and populates it with an unordered list
of items. Here mustache will display the title line, then iterate for
each version in the array creating a list item. Then depending upon
whether the &#8220;available&#8221; data is set or the &#8220;missing&#8221; the content of the
list item will either be a link to the version, or simply list the
revision metadata.</p>

<p>The container folder for the &#8220;upload&#8221; widget.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>async.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Identical to the previous async.js file except in one respect. The
tools/history/async.js file specified the #wiki div to get the document
id from. This file uses &#8220;this&#8221; so I guess will work with whatever
document or div is calling it. It makes sense I guess as you will be
attaching the uploaded file to whatever document provided the content
for the div.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>data.js</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The anonymous function that reacts to the submit event on the form in
the widget. A jquery variable &#8220;form&#8221; is created to represent the
selected form. &#8220;app&#8221; is made available again and the form is serialised
into the &#8220;f&#8221; variable.</p>
<p>A jquery ajax submission is made to the database with the url of the
document. There must be some magic happening somewhere due to the
special _attachment field because I originally thought it had to be a
PUT with content-type specified.</p>
<p>Anyway, then it returns false to stop the normal form submission and on
success sets the browser to the base page again (essentially a refresh
that triggers all the usual init stuff) to display the new attachment
listed at the bottom.</p>

<div class="section" id="wiki-folder">
<h4>wiki (folder)<a class="headerlink" href="#wiki-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Contains the &#8220;wiki&#8221; widget.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="init-js">
<h5>_init.js<a class="headerlink" href="#init-js" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Does the usual initialisation then creates additional variables to hold
the links in the wiki, the pages and the unique links (keys).</p>
<p>A jquery iterator walks through all the &#8220;a&#8221; anchors in the #wiki div. A
regular expression looks at the href that and puts everything after the
&#8220;page&#8221; part of the url into a variable called &#8220;m&#8221;. It then checks to see
if m is set and that there is a part url captured from the regex and
uses it as a key in a &#8220;pages&#8221; array while setting the value to true.
This weeds out duplicate entries. Then the unique keys are pushed into
the &#8220;keys&#8221; array.</p>
<p>If the keys array has some entries the view called &#8220;all-pages&#8221; is run to
retrieve a set of rows from those links that provides the document ids
for those internal linked pages. Upon success, the rows (&#8220;resp&#8221;) are
looped through and if the key exists in the view response it is removed
from the &#8220;pages&#8221; link array. At the end you are left with an array of
internal document links that can&#8217;t be found in the database, so this
array is then used to add a &#8220;missing&#8221; class (via jquery) to the links so
they can be styled with css appropriately.</p>
<p>An error just returns an empty object.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="edit-folder">
<h5>edit (folder)<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The &#8220;edit&#8221; event on the wiki widget.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>async.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Similar to previous async.js files where the document is attempted to be
retrieved and made accessible, but in this case it also has an error
handler defined. This is so that when the edit event is called and a
document does not exist (eg the server returned a 404 code) then the
document is created on the fly.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>data.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Editing the document only requires 4 bits of information from the
existing document, the _id, the _rev, the title and the current
markdown content, so these are retrieved from the document and returned
in an object to be rendered in the template.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>mustache.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The mustache template renders an editing form showing which document is
being edited. It puts the current values into the input fields and
provides an extra field for a note about the changes.</p>
<p>Below the submit button a partial mustache template is rendered called
&#8220;help&#8221; which in this case is a cheatsheet for markdown syntax.</p>
<p>Additionally, two placeholder divs with classes of &#8220;preview&#8221; and
&#8220;clear&#8221;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>partials (folder)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The partials folder contains additional mustache templates for
inclusion. Typically they are used for repetitive or static data such as
headers and footers. Included partial sections have a greater than sign
in the mustaches {{&gt;help}}</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p># help.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This file contains a markdown cheatsheet for display in the editing
form.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>path.txt</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>/edit is the target for this event.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>selectors (folder)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Container for the selectors</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p># form (folder)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Links the event below (submit.js) to the form created in the
mustache.html file</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>## submit.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>All the heavy lifting of the edit happens here. The form is serialized
in the variable &#8220;f&#8221;.</p>
<p>A function called &#8220;saveDoc&#8221; is defined which adds the metadata about the
edit, the log entry, the note and saves the document using the usual
method and a refresh.</p>
<p>Then the serialised form is checked for a revision number setting the
_rev to the one from the document that was edited. If one exists the
document is retrieved and the update saved. If the _rev is missing then
save it as a new document with the id from the serialised form and set
the &#8220;attachPrevRev&#8221; to true so next time this version will be saved to
the new document.</p>
<p>Again, return false to stop the browser submit.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p># textarea[name=markdown] (folder)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Selecting the textarea with the name markdown. (I loved writing that :)
)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>## _init.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This function just triggers the &#8220;keyup&#8221; function after 50 milliseconds.
It is in a loop with the keyup function to constantly update the
markdown/html preview window.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>## keyup.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This function sets &#8220;form&#8221; to be the parent form that triggered the
function. &#8220;prev&#8221; is a div that has a class &#8220;preview&#8221; and the context is
the previously created form jquery object. &#8220;app&#8221; is available as usual.</p>
<p>This time however, the variable &#8220;wiki&#8221; becomes a plugin to encode the
markdown links in the content of the textarea and make them active. The
referenced file is ilb/wiki.js and it in turn utilised
vendor/couchapp/lib/markdown.</p>
<p>The logic of the preview goes like this. If the preview content doesn&#8217;t
match the form content then set the preview content to the form. Then
replace the preview content with the rendered content. Check to see if
there is a &#8220;timeout&#8221; property on the preview div, if not set that
property to trigger the _init function again in 1.1 seconds and delete
the timeout property from the preview div so it is ready to loop again.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="version-folder">
<h5>version (folder)<a class="headerlink" href="#version-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The version event is called from pathbinder looking at the url after the
# and finding the matching event. Additonal parameters are passed in the
url after the initial hash name and thes are passed to the version event
below this folder.</p>
<p>This was all set up in the evently/tools/history/mustache.html template
that created the links</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>&lt;a href=&quot;#/version/{{rev}}&quot;&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>async.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A more interesting async.js this time. Apart from the callback we have
the event and parameters being passed in. The dom, app and docid are set
as usual then a simple ajax GET call is made to retrieve that version of
the document. On completion of the request the json is put into the
variable &#8220;resp&#8221;. The server request status is checked to make sure it
was ok (code 200) and if so the &#8220;resp&#8221; calls back. Alternatively it puts
up an alert that the version could not be retrieved.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>data.js</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Take the returned document and fix the wikilinks and return the rendered
html in a variable called &#8220;body&#8221;</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>mustache.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Replace the inners with the html from data.js</p>

<p>As far as I can see an arbitrary place to put library code.</p>

</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="lists-folder">
<h3>lists (folder)<a class="headerlink" href="#lists-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Special folder that holds all the _list types.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The first list function. I&#8217;m not sure why it is here when the widget
seems to take care of displaying comments. ??? Perhaps some light.</p>
<p>Anyway ... variables &#8220;row&#8221; to hold each iterated returned doc, &#8220;ddoc&#8221; to
hold a reference to the design document it self so we can find the
templates, &#8220;mustache&#8221; is an object that can apply the library functions
and &#8220;markdown&#8221; is similar.</p>
<p>A &#8220;data&#8221; object is created with metadata &#8220;title&#8221;, &#8220;site-title&#8221; (from the
couchapp.json file), &#8220;path&#8221;, and an empty array of &#8220;comments&#8221;.</p>
<p>The return type is specified as html with &#8220;provides&#8221; and an anonymous
function works on each row to create a log entry and push the retrieved
comment object into the comments array.</p>
<p>Finally the whole lot is sent back to the requestor after rendering the
data through markdown and the mustache templates from
templates/comments.html and templates/partials/header.html</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The pages.js list is functionally almost the same as comments.js. An
identical process is followed with a few changes of names of fields etc.
However, the mustache template applied from templates/pages.html is more
ambitious. The same header.html file is used.</p>
<p>The document links are all list items in an unordered list. At the
bottom the standard connection of account and profile divs happens, but
a new variable &#8220;pr&#8221; (short for profileReady) is created and the mustache
property is set to the all.html template in the profileReady widget. A
note to modify that template probably explains why all.html and
mustache.html are currently the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;ddoc&#8221; becomes the design document, &#8220;mustache&#8221; the mustache object,

additional metadata.</p>
